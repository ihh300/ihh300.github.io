I'm a Data Scientist. My interests include data science, data analysis, geospatial analysis, effective data visualization and programming in R and Python.

I also enjoy developing courses and improving data science education.

I previously worked as a (geo) data scientist at CGG, and received three master's degrees: the first one in engineering (INSA Lyon), the second in marketing (HEC Paris) and the third one in geosciences/geophysics (UPMC Paris University).

In addition, I am an honor graduate of the York University, Certificate in Big Data Analytics, Advanced Data Science and Predictive Analytics.

As a project or team manager, I enjoy coordinating team work using Six Sigma (Certified Lean Six Sigma Green Belt) or Agile (Certified AGILE Scrum MasterÂ®).

I am bilingual English/French and have knowledge of Spanish and German.
