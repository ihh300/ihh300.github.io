I am a Software Engineer with experience in data science and machine learning development. My interests include data science, machine learning, effective visualization and programming in R and Python.

I also enjoy developing courses and improving data science and coding education.

I previously worked as a (geo) data scientist at CGG, and received two master's degrees in Science: the first one in engineering (INSA Lyon), the second in geosciences/geophysics (UPMC Paris University). In addition, I am an honor graduate of the York University, Program, a dual Certificate in Big Data Analytics, Advanced Data Science and Predictive Analytics.

My background in engineering and physics has given me a strong foundation for using logic to answer interesting questions, to develop solutions, to design and integrate systems, and communicate about technical topics with diverse audiences.

As a project or team manager, I enjoy coordinating team work using Six Sigma (Certified Lean Six Sigma Green Belt) or having a servant leadership approach within Agile team dynamic (Certified AGILE Scrum Master®).

I am bilingual English/French and have knowledge of Spanish and German.
